## General Information
- Building ML model to understand how exactly the house prices vary with different variables in order to  manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
- The company wants to know:
	- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
	- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

- Lasso regression removed significant number of features thereby hlping in feature reduction
- LotFrontage is the most significant feature for the sales price
